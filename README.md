## Milestones and current status

### Milestone 1: Project Setup

In the first milestone, we focused on creating and setting up the **GitHub repository** to establish a solid foundation for project development. This included:
- Initial repository setup with essential files (`README.md`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`)
- Basic configuration for future cloud deployment.
- Documentation covering
  - problem
  - solution
  - target group
  - core features
  - technology

For detailed information regarding the application refer to the [Documentation](docs/hito_1/hito-1-Description.md).

For detailed information regarding the git setup refer to the [Documentation](docs/hito_1/hito-1-GitDocumentation.md).


### Milestone 2: Continuous Integration (CI) Implementation

We implemented continuous integration (CI) for the second milestone. It includes: 
- Task Manager
- Testing System and Assertion Library
- Test Classes
- Setting up Continous Integration
- Verify CI Github

For detailed information on the current status and setup, refer to the [Documentation](docs/hito-2-CICD-Documentation.md).


### Milestone 3: Microservices Design
We designed and implemented a microservice for managing Pokémon and users using FastAPI. The key accomplishments include:
- **API Design:** Defined routes for user registration, login, adding, retrieving, searching, and deleting Pokémon.
- **Logging System:** Implemented a logging system to log API activity using the `logging` module.
- **Testing:** Implemented thorough tests for user registration, login, adding, retrieving, searching, and deleting Pokémon using `pytest`.

For detailed information on the current status and setup, refer to the [Documentation](docs/hito-3-API-Documentation.md).


### Milestone 4: Containers
In this milestone, we used Docker Compose to describe the infrastructure through a compose.yaml file in order to design a service that includes several containers. One of the container is exclusive to store data. We use Docker compose to describe the relationship of the containers to each other in a repeatable way.

For detailed information on the current status and setup, refer to the [Documentation](docs/hito-4-Container-Documentation.md).

### Hito 5 - PoDeMaster PaaS Deployment
In this milestone, we deployed our PoDeMaster Application to the PaaS platform Fly.io. 
We chose Fly.io for this milestone because it offers an easy and efficient way to deploy applications with minimal configuration and without great effort. Furthermore it offers Docker support and easy continous deployment integration with GitHub Actions. Additionally it is possible to connect a free Database (Supabase) to our project without paying more. 

For detailed information, refer to the [Documentation](docs/hito-5-Deployment-Documentation.md).

## Project Goal
The goal of PoDeMaster is to offer a centralized platform to help all Pokémon players worldwide maintain an overview of their catched Pokémon. They should be able to: 
- Register as a new User
- Login as a User
- Update their Collection by stating what they catched and in which game
- Trade with other users
